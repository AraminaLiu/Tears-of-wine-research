# Tears-of-wine-research
Motivated by a recent study by Dukler et al[1] on unclassical undercompressive shocks in tears of wine, in this research, 
we focus on the effects of general substrate geometry on the dynamics of thin liquid films. 
In particular, our research work notices that the model studied by Dukler[1] is limited to the dynamics on a conical substrate. 
We generalize this model to characterize various nonlinear substrate geometry of wine glasses by incorporating a functional term for the azimuthal cur-vature term. 
Complicated curvature-induced shock transitions are expected to occur when these nonlinear substrate effects are introduced. 
Relevant literature on the modeling and numerical methods of lubrication models on a curved substrate include the work of Roys et al.[4] and Greer et al.[2]. 
We employ a surface of revolution to approximate a typical wine glass substrate. 
The resulting governing equation takes into consideration of a constant surface tension gradient, both tangential and normal components of the gravity,
and the bulk surface tension term. The substrate effects are incorporated into both the tangential and normal components of the gravity term, 
and the azimuthal curvature term in the governing equation.
